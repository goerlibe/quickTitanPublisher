quick and dirty tool to publish titan-related messages

install:
yarn

start:
yarn run watch
(will automatically restart if you change code)

use: 
visit localhost:3000/connect , fill out the form and submit
you will be forwarded to localhost:3000/publish (if you visit this directly you will get a nasty error)
fill out the form and submit 
    if you chose `do not use quick publish options` you can configure topic and body yourself (prefix will be added automatically), empty body will be discarded
    you can also chose one of the quick options (e.g. start). in this case the custom topic and body will be ignored and a preconfigured msg will be published
